> Magic is distilled laziness

This theme, named after the fantasy setting of [Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/), is designed with tabletop RPG players in mind. The theme allows beautiful HTML exports designed to look like a professionally made tabletop resource, whilst remaining easy to edit in code view and in small windows, thanks to CSS media queries.
